# About ACM at Allegheny

## Our Mission

The Allegheny College chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery works to develop technical skills across the campus community and foster interdisciplinary collaboration through events like the Afternoon of Code!

## Our Purpose

Both the Allegheny Chapters of the Association for Computing Machinery and of Upsilon Pi Epsilon are wholeheartedly dedicated to using our skills to better our community. The Afternoon of Code is our first event in a series that aims to serve not only our campus, but the greater area of Meadville as well.

We're starting closer to home, fostering relationships with the other student organizations on campus so that they might join us in our pursuits in the future.

## What We Do

ACM at Allegheny provides opportunities for students to:

- **Learn and Grow**: Develop technical skills through workshops, coding events, and hands-on projects
- **Connect**: Build relationships with fellow students, faculty, and industry professionals
- **Collaborate**: Work on interdisciplinary projects that bring together different areas of study
- **Give Back**: Use our computing skills to serve our campus and local community

## Get Involved

Whether you're a computer science major, a student from another discipline interested in technology, or someone just curious about computing, we welcome you to join our community. Check out our [calendar](/calendar/) for upcoming events or [join us](/join/) to become a member!
